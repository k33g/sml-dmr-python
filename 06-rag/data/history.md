# Hawaiian Pizza History

## Origins
Hawaiian pizza was invented in 1962 by Sam Panopoulos, a Greek-Canadian restaurateur, at his restaurant in Chatham, Ontario, Canada.

## The Story
Panopoulos was experimenting with different pizza toppings when he decided to try combining ham and pineapple. He named it "Hawaiian" pizza, inspired by the brand of canned pineapple he used.

## Initial Reception
The combination was initially met with skepticism, but it gradually gained popularity, especially in Canada and later internationally.

## Cultural Impact
Hawaiian pizza became one of the most controversial pizza toppings, sparking debates worldwide about whether pineapple belongs on pizza.
