# What is a GenAI App?

*"A GenAI application is a software system that leverages generative artificial intelligence models (like LLMs) to create new content such as text, images, code, or audio based on user inputs or prompts."*

## LLM = Large Language Model

*"An LLM (Large Language Model) is a neural network (deep learning model) trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text by predicting the next token in a sequence."*
